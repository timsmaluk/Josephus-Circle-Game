# Josephus-Circle-Game
An animation of the famous Josephus Problem

The game board consists of blue and yellow circles that represent
soldiers in a circle. Facing execution, they decide to kill themselves
in order to avoid imprisonment. However, you decide that you would
rather face prison than face death. Choose a spot in the circle to
stand where you will avoid death. 

The kill order for n=6 is as follows:
1 kills 2,
3 kills 4,
5 kills 6,
1 kills 3,
5 kills 1

*** 5 is the winner ***

Hint: The white circle is the first killer
